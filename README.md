## Todo List Rails app

## What this app does

This is a very basic rails app. You can create list and add items to it. Also, you can perform some actions on list and items: delete, create and edit. There's also a very simple feature to mark items as completed.

The goal of this app is to learn how a rails app works. Don't expect to find a very pretty app, that's not my goal, feel free to add colors if you want =).

I created this app following a Threehouse tutorial. 

There's still a few things I don't understand (black magic!) but I have to say I kind of like ruby and rails.

## What I learned with this app

* Gems: rspec, capybara, shoulda-matchers.
* Rails `generate` command line.
* Migration: `rake db:migrate`.
* `before_action`.
* Routes `rake routes`.
* Relationships `has_many` and `belong_to`.
* TEST, TEST, TEST, TEST, TEST EVERYWHERE.
* Validations.
* Rails scope `scope`.
